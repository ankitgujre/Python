'''
Python data types are actually classes, and the defined variables are their instances 
or objects.
Since Python is dynamically typed, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime
based on the assigned value.

# Types of Data Types in Python

# 1. Python Numeric Data Types

var1 = 1       # int data type
var2 = True    # bool data type
var3 = 10.023  # float data type
var4 = 10+3j   # complex data type

print(var1, type(var1))
print(var2, type(var2))
print(var3, type(var3))
print(var4, type(var4))
